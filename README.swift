 As this is my first project after completing Apple's Developing with Swift
 tutotrial, I had to research and find solutions to features the tutorial didn't cover.
 I discovered a lot of great blogs and code out there that that I want to give credit
 to. I appreciate them sharing their knowledge.
 
 Credit to:
    https://www.markusbodner.com/ for the tutorial on how to
    verify and limit decimal number input UITextField
 
    https://github.com/hijamoya/PickerViewCell for how to
    create a custom UIPickerView with custon UITableViewCell classes and extension.
